# Geometry-Dash-All-In-One
Every Geometry Dash version until 2.2, downloaded by using the download_depot command in the Steam console and SteamDB manifests from oldest to newest.

**BEFORE PLAYING**: You need a Steam emulator to play these versions.

**NOTICE:** *Some of the levels may have been played by me: Stereo Madness and other levels may show a percentage of the level played. Ignore that.*
